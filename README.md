# LearnAcademy

I built a feature-rich full-stack course selling website using the MERN stack (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React).

## Admin Dashboard
1. The admin side of the course selling app.
2. Admins can effortlessly log in or register a new account.
3. All admins have the power to:
    ✅ CREATE courses
    ✏️ UPDATE courses
    ❌ DELETE courses

## User Dashboard
1. The user side of the course-selling app
2. Users can conveniently log in or register a new account.
3. Users get access to a wide range of courses to explore and learn from.
4. Users can seamlessly purchase their preferred courses! 💡

Note: The payment system and uploading of course content are still not in place.
