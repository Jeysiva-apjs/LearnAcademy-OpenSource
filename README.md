# LearnAcademy

I built a feature-rich full-stack course selling website using the MERN stack (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React).

## Admin Dashboard
1️⃣. The admin side of the course selling app.
2️⃣. Admins can effortlessly log in or register a new account.
3️⃣. All admins have the power to:
    ✅ CREATE courses
    ✏️ UPDATE courses
    ❌ DELETE courses

## User Dashboard
1️⃣. The user side of the course selling app.
2️⃣. Users can conveniently log in or register a new account.
3️⃣. Users get access to a wide range of courses to explore and learn from.
4️⃣. Users can seamlessly purchase their preferred courses! 💡

##### Note: The payment system and uploading of course content are still not in place.
